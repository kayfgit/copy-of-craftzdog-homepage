## Copy of Takuya's website

Decided to try out my Next, Tailwind and Framer Motion knowledge by copying Devaslife homepage. I thought it turned out pretty good, well, besides the Voxeldog.. 😛

## Seeing the result

Clone the repo: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kayfgit/copy-of-craftzdog-homepage.git
cd copy-of-craftzdog-homepage
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To check it out, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
